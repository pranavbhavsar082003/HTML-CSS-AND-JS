<p>Picture perfect, you don't need no filter </p>
<p>Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you're a killer</p>
<p>Shower you with all my attention</p>
<p>Yeah, these are my only intentions</p>
<p>Stay in the kitchen cookin' up, got your own bread</p>
<p>Heart full of equity or an asset</p>
<p>Make sure that you don't need no mentions</p>
<p>Yeah, these are my only intentions</p>
<p>Shout out to your mom and dad for makin' you</p>
<p>Standin' ovation, they did a great job raisin' you</p>
<p>When I create you're my muse</p>
<p>That kind of smile that makes the news</p>
<p>Can't nobody throw shade on your name in these streets</p>
<p>Triple threat, you're a boss, you a bae, you a beast</p>
<p>You make it easy to choose</p>
<p>You got a mean touch, I can't refuse (No, I can't refuse it)</p>
<p>Picture perfect, you don't need no filter</p>
<p>make 'em drop dead, you're a killer</p>
<p>Shower you with all my attention</p>
<p>Yeah, these are my only intentions</p>
<p>Stay in the kitchen cookin' up, got your own bread</p>
<p>Heart full of equity or an asset</p>
<p>Make sure that you don't need no mentions</p>
<p>Yeah, these are my only intentions</p>
<p>Already passed, you don't need no approval</p>
<p>everywhere, don't worry 'bout no refusal</p>
<p>Second to none, you got the upper hand now</p>
<p>Don't need a sponsor, nope, you're the brand now</p>
<p>You're my rock, my Colorado</p>
<p>Got that ring, just like Toronto</p>
<p>Lovin' you now, a little more tomorrow</p>
<p>That's how I feel, act like you know that you are</p>
<p>Picture perfect, you don't need no filter</p>
<p>make 'em drop dead, you're a killer</p>
<p>Shower you with all my attention</p>
<p>Yeah, these are my only intentions</p>
<p>Stay in the kitchen cookin' up, got you're own bread (Whip it)</p>
<p>Heart full of equity or an asset (Asset)</p>
<p>Make sure that you don't need no mentions (Yeah, yeah)</p>
<p>Yeah, these are my only intentions (Quavo)</p>
<p>No cap, no pretending'</p>
<p>don't need mentions (No cap)</p>
<p>Got 'em saying' "goals", they don't wanna be independent ('Pendent)</p>
<p>Tell them to mind your business (Woo), we in our feelings</p>
<p>It's fifty-fifty percentage (Fifty)</p>
<p>Attention, we need commitment (Oh)</p>
<p>We got it both admitted (Both)</p>
<p>It's funny we both listen (Both)</p>
<p>It's a blessing (Blessing) 'cause we both get it (Both)</p>
<p>You the best thing and I don't need a witness (Best thing)</p>
<p>I'ma find me a ring and pray it's perfect fitted (Perfect, perfect)</p>
<p>Picture perfect, you don't need no filter (No filter)</p>
<p>Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer (Oh-oh)</p>
<p>Shower you with all my attention (I will)</p>
<p>Yeah, these are my only intentions (Yeah)</p>
<p>Stay in the kitchen cooking' up, got your own bread (You do)</p>
<p>Heart full of equity, you're an asset (Uh-uh)</p>
<p>Make sure that you don't need no mentions (No mentions)</p>
<p>Yeah, these are my only intentions</p>
<p>Only intentions</p>
<p>That's all I plan to do</p>
